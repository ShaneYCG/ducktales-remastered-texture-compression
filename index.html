		<h1>RGBV Texture Compression in DuckTales: Remastered</h1>
		<sub>By Shane Calimlim <a href="mailto:shanecalimlim@gmail.com">email</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ShaneCalimlim">twitter</a></sub>
		<p>
			WayForward's art style is one of its signatures.  Ensuring that our
			texture compression can preserve the amazing work done by our
			artists is a top priority, especially when revisiting beloved
			franchises like DuckTales.  In the past we were bound to paletted
			pixel art on sprite hardware, but our HD style on modern hardware
			has very different characteristics.  After trying many approaches
			we landed on something that works well for our art style and excels
			on a wide variety of images.
		</p>
		<p>
			In terms of hardware support,
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S3_Texture_Compression">DXT</a>
			is the modern equivalent to palettes.  DXT works on 4x4 blocks of
			pixels, choosing two (16 bit) primary colors, with the ability to
			represent some colors (linearly-interpolated) between them.  Given
			its blocky nature it tends to artifact in ways similar to JPEG.
			Like JPEG, DXT works pretty well on most images.  Unfortunately our
			art assets seem to hit DXT’s weak spots on the head and artifacts
			are very obvious.

		<p class="imageNotes">
			(1) Images are at 2x zoom.<br>
			(2) DXT compression by <a href="https://code.google.com/p/libsquish/">libsquish</a> with highest quality settings.
		</p>
		<p>
			Switching away from DXT entirely would be ideal, but the
			performance sacrifices necessary to do so are unacceptable (much
			more memory, slower texture lookups).  We weren’t alone in reaching
			this conclusion.  There are many variations that seek to utilize
			the DXT format by applying additional encoding on top of it to
			improve image quality.  We had varying levels of success with
			these, but kept running into the same issue:  while overall color
			accuracy was improved, blocky artifacts were still common.  Most
			variants also sacrificed the alpha channel to store extra data, but
			alpha is key to our HD style.  This is not surprising, given that
			DXT works reasonably well on most photorealistic images, so
			focusing on improving color accuracy beyond DXT’s 16 bit colors is
			sensible.  Modern 3D games also rarely use alpha, so repurposing
			it incurs no additional cost.
		</p>
		<p>
			But we were still without a solution, so we opted to try something
			new.  The requirements were strict:
			<ol>
				<li>
					It must pass the scrutiny of art directors and designers
				</li>
				<li>
					It must not be larger than DXT5, our VRAM budget was
					already designed around this
				</li>
				<li>
					It must not impose a heavy shader cost, we were already
					pushing the GPU hard (1080p @ 60 w/ AA)
				</li>
				<li>
					It must build quickly, to maintain fast iteration
				</li>
				<li>
					It must allow us to have soft edges on our characters (lest
					we fail #1)
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Existing techniques improve color accuracy by separating
			luma/brightness from color data.  Our eyes are very sensitive to
			luminance variation, and splitting this data apart can increase
			perceived quality significantly.  While we opted to focus less on
			perfect color accuracy and more on reducing DXT block artifacts, we
			landed on a very similar approach, but admittedly simpler in
			concept.  In our art a lot of color variation was from shading and
			outlines – both variations in brightness.  Outlines in particular
			tended to introduce more colors in a block than DXT could deal
			with.  We had decided early on to try to keep the shader cost of
			reconstruction as cheap as possible, ideally a single multiply.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have one texture with the colors at full-bright and a multiply
			map to lower them back down.  For the color map, colors are scaled
			around the highest channel.  The multiply map stores the value used
			to scale the color map.  Mathematically, our multiply map is
			equivalent to the V in
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">HSV</a>.  And
			our color map is equivalent to converting to HSV, setting V to max,
			and converting back to RGB.
		</p>
		<p>
			Encoding:
		</p>
		<pre>if( r == g && g == b ) { // avoid division by zero, and handle gray
	colorMapR = colorMapG = colorMapB = 1.0f;
	mulMap = r;
} else {
	float maxChannel = max( r, g, b );
	colorMapR = r / maxChannel;
	colorMapG = g / maxChannel;
	colorMapB = b / maxChannel;
	mulMap = maxChannel;
}</pre>

		<div class="image">
			<span class="imageDesc">Color</span>
			<img src="images/scrooge-opaque-color.png">
		</div>
		<div class="image">
			<span class="imageDesc">Multiply</span>
			<img src="images/scrooge-opaque-mul.png">
		</div>
		<p>
			For black pixels, the multiply value is zero – making the color
			value irrelevant.  To reduce artifacts we do some post-processing
			and ‘borrow’ colors from neighboring pixels when a color value
			does not matter.
		</p>
		<div class="image">
			<span class="imageDesc">Padded Color</span>
			<img src="images/scrooge-opaque-color-padded.png">
		</div>
		<p class="imageNotes">
			(1)	We borrow colors for fully-transparent pixels as well as black, when applicable.<br>
			(2)	It is important to consider the bit-depth of the destination DXT data when determining whether a pixel is ‘black’;  a pixel with a value of 1/255 will floor to zero when stored in a 5/6-bit DXT channel.
		</p>
		<p>
			We’re left with two maps that fit DXT very well.  The color map
			rarely has more than two distinct colors in a given 4x4 block.  The
			multiply map is single-channel, so its values will always
			interpolate decently between two endpoints.  Reconstruction in the
			shader is trivial, the output color is simply multiplying the two
			maps together.
		</p>
		<p>
			Decoding:
		</p>
		<pre>float3 wfDecodeRGBV( float3 colorMap, float mulMap ) {
	return colorMap*mulMap
}</pre>
		<div class="image">

			(1) The background is solid white;  there is no transparency.<br>
			(2) The RGBV image is stored in a DXT5 texture, with the multiply
			map in the alpha channel.
		</p>
		<p>
			Adding alpha while staying within our #2 requirement was difficult.
			Luckily the art style in DuckTales happens to line up with a trick
			in our texture encoding, so we can work in the subset of alpha we
			need for (almost) free.  Most of the time we only need
			partial-alpha on the character silhouettes.  Character outlines in
			DuckTales are almost always black.  As mentioned earlier, when a
			pixel is black the color value is irrelevant.  We exploit this to
			store partial alpha values on black pixels.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are many ways to encode this, but doing so in a manner that
			interpolates properly and creates minimal artifacts required some
			trial-and-error.  We store our maps in separate DXT1 textures, with
			the multiply map in the green channel of the second texture, rather
			than using DXT5 with the multiply map in the alpha channel.  This
			was a gut-decision based on texture-cache characteristics of some
			of our target platforms – we have not benchmarked to verify if it
			is worthwhile – and it does reduce the quality of our multiply map.
			However, this does give us DXT1’s 1-bit alpha flags to play with
			(and some unused channels that could possibly be used to extend the
			format later).
		</p>
		<p>
			If a pixel is non-opaque the color map’s alpha is set to zero and
			the multiply map stores the alpha value. This reduces the total
			number of colors DXT can represent in the block from 4 to 3, but
			this is insignificant in our color maps (and it would always happen
			within the black outline).
		</p>
		<p>
			If a pixel is opaque the multiply value is inverted.  Our outlines
			fade out over several pixels, so we have fully-opaque black pixels
			(rgb=0/255) adjacent to a nearly-opaque ones (a=254/255). With the
			inversion these two pixels have nearly the same value in the
			multiply map, preventing artifacts when bilinear filtering is
			applied.
		</p>
		<p>
			Encoding:
		</p>
		<pre>if( r == g && g == b ) { // avoid division by zero, and handle gray
	colorMapR = colorMapG = colorMapB = 1.0f;
	mulMap = r;
} else {
	float maxChannel = max( r, g, b );
	colorMapR = r / maxChannel;
	colorMapG = g / maxChannel;
	colorMapB = b / maxChannel;
	mulMap = maxChannel;
}
if( a == 1.0f ) {
	colorMapA = 1.0f;
	mulMap = 1.0f - mulMap;
} else {
	colorMapA = 0.0f;
	mulMap = a;
}</pre>
		<div class="image">
			<span class="imageDesc">Multiply with Alpha</span>
			<img src="images/scrooge-alpha-mul.png">
		</div>
		<p>
			Reconstruction is more expensive than the original single-mul
			variant of our approach, but still very cheap.  If the color map is
			not opaque black is returned with alpha equal to the value in the
			multiply texture.  Otherwise, the color map is multiplied by the
			re-inverted multiply texture and returned with full alpha.
		</p>
		<p>
			Decoding:
		</p>
		<pre>if( tex0.a != 1.0 ) {
    return float4( 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, tex1.g );
} else {
    float3 mask = 1.0f - tex1.ggg;
    return float4 ( tex0.rgb*mask, 1.0f );
}</pre>
		<p>
			To remove the branch, we use this slight modification:
		</p>
<pre>float3 mask = (1.0f-tex1.ggg) * floor(tex0.aaa);
return float4( tex0.rgb*mask, tex0.a+tex1.g );</pre>
		<p>
			The overall result is an image the same size as DXT5, trading some
			alpha precision for a large reduction in color artifacts.  The
			color map also lends itself well to lossless compression, reducing
			disk size significantly compared to unmodified DXT when used with
			<a href="https://github.com/ShaneYCG/wflz">wfLZ</a>.

			There is still room for improvement, especially in general-purpose
			and photorealistic use.
			<ul>
				<li>
					If the algorithm were more DXT-block aware it could
					sacrifice color accuracy on pixels with low luminance when
					the block contained multiple high luminance colors.
				</li>
				<li>
					For opaque variants, a lower-resolution color map probably
					works well.
				</li>
				<li>
					The algorithm attempts to take into account DXT bit depth,
					but only at select times.  Making the entire algorithm
					aware of these limitations would improve accuracy.
				</li>
				<li>
					The primary goal of this algorithm is to reduce DXT block
					artifacts, tighter integration with the DXT encoder would
					likely improve results.
				</li>
				<li>
					The color map is independent of the multiply map.  The
					multiply map could be made after the color map is converted
					to DXT, and a more accurate multiply map generated.  This
					process could potentially be made iterative.
				</li>
				<li>
					Gray is encoded as pure white in the color map, which may
					not always be optimal.  Gray is an edge case most of the
					time, but a smarter encoding algorithm could make vast
					improvements in its handling.  In the simple version of the
					algorithm the entire burden of representing gray lies with
					the multiply map;  this could be split between both maps,
					improving precision greatly in scenarios where the color
					map can accomodate extra data without loss.
				</li>
				<li>
					Precision should be gained by adding scaling.  Simple
					map-wide scaling factors could be added:
					<pre>map = tex*scale + min; // with scale and min passed in as shader uniforms</pre>
					Id Software’s
					<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/real-time-ycocg-dxt-compression.html">YCoCg variant</a>
					uses a more advanced per-block scaling method that could be applied here as well.
				</li>
				<li>
					Our approach is very similar to
					<a href="http://graphicrants.blogspot.com/2009/04/rgbm-color-encoding.html">RGBM</a>
					encoding, but RGBM is aimed at HDR framebuffers not DXT
					textures.  We have not investigated extending our format to
					HDR, but a combination of the two could work well.
				</li>
				<li>
					The free-alpha-on-black variant could be reworked to use
					DXT5's alpha channel for the multiply map.  If we use that
					trick for another game, we will definitely switch.
					Alternatively, the unused DXT1 channels could possibly be
					used to store alternate outline colors.  But writing an
					encoder that could do this automatically would be difficult.
				</li>
